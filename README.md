# My Space

This project, called My Space, is an application developed with Django 4, focused on creating an interactive interface for displaying images and their respective contexts. The main goal is to provide a pleasant user experience, allowing visitors to click on images to view them in a larger size, accompanied by relevant information. I used partially a code made by Alura.

# Main Functionalities

- Page Rendering: We use Django to render dynamic pages, ensuring that the front-end and back-end work in harmony.

- Different Routes: The application is structured with routes that facilitate navigation between different sections.
Static File Loading: We learn how to manage static files efficiently, maintaining the project's organization.

- Good Programming Practices: The course emphasizes the importance of avoiding duplicate code and keeping the code clean and organized.

- GitHub Integration: The project includes guidelines on how to upload the code to GitHub, ensuring that sensitive information, such as environment variables, are not exposed.
